CodeDOM exercise

Does three things:

1) Autogenerates code containing a function that adds 2 parameters (integers) "add2integers.cs"
2) Compiles the code into a dll file "libraryadd2ints.dll"
3) Uses built-in functionality of the compiled dll in part 2) to add 2 numbers

This is a simple program that utilizes various functionalities of CodeDOM to execute a certain task

I tested it with Visual Studio 2015.
